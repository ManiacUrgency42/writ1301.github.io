# Engineering Sustainable Performance: The 2026 F1 Hybrid Power Unit

## Leonard

My focus is how F1’s next-gen hybrid powertrain (engine + electric system) will work with 100% “drop-in” sustainable fuel (synthetic fuel that can run in existing engine designs), while staying fast and reliable. My three main sub-topics:

1. Hybrid integration: how the internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric side (battery, MGU-K motor on the crankshaft for braking energy, and MGU-H on the turbo for exhaust energy) share power and when.

2. Thermal management: how the car keeps temperatures safe (engine, battery, power electronics, brakes) without adding too much weight or drag from cooling.

3. Energy recovery: how much energy can be recovered (mainly from braking and exhaust), where it’s stored or rerouted, and how controls decide to deploy it (for lap time and overtaking).
