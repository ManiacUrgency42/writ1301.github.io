# Sustainability for Formula 1's Long Logistics

# Emissions Comparison: Air vs Sea Freight

Air freight produces much higher CO₂ emissions per tonne-kilometer than sea freight. Switching intercontinental logistics from planes to cleaner-fuel cargo ships could reduce emissions from these transport legs by 60–90%, depending on the fuel used.

# Cost Comparison: Air vs Sea Freight

While sea freight is slower, it is generally equal in cost or slightly cheaper compared to air transportation.
If Formula 1 uses a rotating equipment system (one set racing, one set shipping, one set preparing), the slower shipping time does not affect the race calendar.
