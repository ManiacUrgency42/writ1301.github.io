# Sustainability for Formula 1's Long Logistics

## Thomas

Formula 1 has committed to becoming Net Zero Carbon by 2030, with logistics being one of the largest contributors to its emissions. Freight movement especially air cargo—makes up nearly half of F1’s carbon footprint. Reducing aviation usage and shifting toward cleaner transportation methods is one of the most practical and high-impact ways F1 can meaningfully lower emissions (Formula 1, 2025).

# Emissions Comparison: Air vs Sea Freight

Air freight produces far more CO₂ emissions per tonne-kilometer than sea freight. Switching long-distance logistics from planes to ships using cleaner marine fuels could reduce emissions by 60–90%.

While sea freight is slower, it is generally equal in cost or slightly cheaper compared to air transportation.
If Formula 1 uses a rotating equipment system (one set racing, one set shipping, one set preparing), the slower shipping time does not affect the race calendar.

# Rotational Equipment Strategy

To maintain race timing while using slower but cleaner shipping, F1 could divide equipment into three sets:

Set A is used at the current race.

Set B is already being shipped by sea to the next continent.

Set C is being serviced and prepared at the factory.

By constantly rotating these sets, the championship can operate normally, while aviation usage is reduced.

# Additional Logistics Solutions

Formula 1 and DHL have already begun using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for cargo flights, cutting aviation emissions by up to 19% (DHL Group, 2024).

Biofuel-powered freight trucks used during the European season have reduced emissions from road logistics by 83% (DHL Group, 2024).

Sustainable marine fuel is considered the next major step for sea shipping logistics, helping lower emissions across long-distance freight shipping (Seatrade Maritime, 2024).

# Why This Matters

Shifting overseas logistics to sea freight would:

Significantly reduce emissions related to transportation.

Maintain the same race schedule without delays.

Avoid increasing transportation cost, and may even reduce expenses slightly.

Support the Net Zero 2030 target in a measurable and achievable way.


Reducing engine emissions alone is not enough for F1 to reach its Net Zero goal. Transforming logistics—specifically by replacing long-distance air freight with low-emission sea freight—offers one of the largest and most practical carbon reductions available. With planning and equipment rotation, this change can be made without reducing the number of races.
