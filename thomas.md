# Sustainability for Formula 1's Long Logistics

# Emissions Comparison: Air vs Sea Freight

Air freight produces much higher CO₂ emissions per tonne-kilometer than sea freight. Switching intercontinental logistics from planes to cleaner-fuel cargo ships could reduce emissions from these transport legs by 60–90%, depending on the fuel used.

# Cost Comparison: Air vs Sea Freight

While sea freight is slower, it is generally equal in cost or slightly cheaper compared to air transportation.
If Formula 1 uses a rotating equipment system (one set racing, one set shipping, one set preparing), the slower shipping time does not affect the race calendar.

# Rotational Equipment Strategy

To maintain race timing while using slower but cleaner shipping, F1 could divide equipment into three sets:

Set A is used at the current race.

Set B is already being shipped by sea to the next continent.

Set C is being serviced and prepared at the factory.

By constantly rotating these sets, the championship can operate normally, while aviation usage is reduced.

# Why This Matters

Shifting overseas logistics to sea freight would:

Significantly reduce emissions related to transportation.

Maintain the same race schedule without delays.

Avoid increasing transportation cost, and may even reduce expenses slightly.

Support the Net Zero 2030 target in a measurable and achievable way.


Reducing engine emissions alone is not enough for F1 to reach its Net Zero goal. Transforming logistics—specifically by replacing long-distance air freight with low-emission sea freight—offers one of the largest and most practical carbon reductions available. With planning and equipment rotation, this change can be made without reducing the number of races.
